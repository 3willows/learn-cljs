# Section 4: Functions

Given that ClojureScript is a functional programming language, functions play a key role
in the code that we write. In fact, functions are so central to writing idiomatic ClojureScript
that we will dedicate a whole section to learning about them. Fist, we will take a high-level look
at the concepts and patterns that are critical to writing clean functional code. Next, we will
look at the special class of _first class_ functions, which either take other functions as parameters
or return other functions. After that, we will look at multimethods, which are functions that have
multiple implementations that have very flexible dispatch. Finally, we will return to the text-based
adventure game that we created in [Lesson 10](/section-2/lesson-10-making-choices/) and upgrade it
with some functional improvements.
