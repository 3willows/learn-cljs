# Section 4: Idiomatic ClojureScript

ClojureScript is more than just an alien syntax for writing JavaScript. It is a well-designed
language with its own idioms and best practices. In the first three sections, we approached
ClojureScript in a way that made it as familiar as possible to JavaScript programmers. However,
in order to become as effective as possible with the language, we need to learn how to write
idiomatic ClojureScript. First, we will consider learn how to write pure, well-factored functional
programs that operate on immutable data. Next, we will learn about namespaces - the unit of
modularity - and how to effectively lay out a larger project. Then we will take a brief survey of
the library functionality that we get out of the box with the Google Closure Library. After this,
we'll finally learn how to deal with state that changes over time, which will be a critical component
to most of the applications that we build. After learning about state, we will look at our options
for dealing with when things go wrong. Finally, we will learn the basic of working with
ClojureScript's preferred concurrency model and the core.async library that implements this model.
The capstone will lean on all of these concepts to create a group chat application.
