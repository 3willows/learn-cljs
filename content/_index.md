## About the author

Andrew has been writing Clojure code both personally and professionally since 2012. He lives in Colorado with his wife, four children, and a rabbit. Andrew works as a software engineer at [deref](https://www.deref.io/), fulfilling his lifelong dream of creating a database from scratch. Yes, he's that much of a nerd. When he has a chance to write a UI, he always uses ClojureScript (naturally).
