## About the author

Andrew has been writing Clojure code both personally and since 2012. He lives in
Colorado with his wife, four children, and a couple of toads that found their way into his
window well. Andrew works as a software architect at [Quantum Metric](https://www.quantummetric.com),
where he focuses on prototyping data-intensive applications. When he has a chance to write a
UI, he always uses ClojureScript (naturally).
