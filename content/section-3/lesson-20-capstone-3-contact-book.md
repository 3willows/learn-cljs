# Lesson 20: Capstone 3 - Contact Book

Over the past few lessons, we have learned the core tools for working with data in
ClojureScript. First, we learned about the basic collection types - lists, vectors,
maps, and sets - as well as the most common functions for working with these collection
types. Then we took a closer look at the important _sequence abstraction_ that allows
us to operate with all sorts of sequential data with a uniform interface. Next, we
discovered the `reduce` function and the many cases in which it can be applied to
summarize a sequence of data. Last, we walked through the process of modeling a real-
world domain. With this knowledge in our possession, we are ready to build another
capstone project - this time, a contact book that will keep personal details for
friends and loved ones.
