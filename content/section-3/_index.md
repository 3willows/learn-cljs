# Section 3: Working With Data

In this section, we will get to know one of the most distinguishing features of ClojureScript - its
library of immutable collections and the functions that operate on them. First, we will survey
the collections that ClojureScript offers as part of its standard library. Next, we will study the
_sequence_ abstraction that is one of the core abstractions of the language. Then we will devote an
entire lesson to _reduce_, the most general and powerful function that operates on the sequence
abstraction. We will finish this section by applying ClojureScript's collection types to real-world
domain modeling. For the capstone, we will create a simple but functional contact book application.
