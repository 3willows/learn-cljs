# Lesson 30: Capstone 5 - Agile Estimates

Congratulations! At this point, we have learned enough ClojureScript to write pretty
much any sort of app that we would like. Sure, over the coming chapters, we will pick
up some tools and techniques that will make us more productive, but nothing is
stopping us from writing complete, production-quality apps with what we have learned
so far. For this capstone, we will be writing a realtime group chat application -
similar to a very slimmed-down version of Slack. You can connect to a live instance of
this application at https://chat.learn-cljs.com/.

*In This Lesson:*

- Design a non-trivial application in terms of state, events, and components
- Interact with a WebSocket API
- Learn some principles for refactoring
